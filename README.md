# Number Guesser
Number Guesser is a basic number guessing game written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. The game allows the user to try and guess the number randomly generated by the computer. The user can adjust the range of numbers the computer can generate a number from; for example, 0 through 10, 10 through 100, etc. If the guess is incorrect, the user will see a message that the guess was either too high or too low.

Once the random number is guessed, the user can choose to play again. If they do, the lowest number in the range is decreased by 10 and the highest number in the range is increased by 10 for the next round.
