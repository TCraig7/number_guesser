# Number Guesser
Number Guesser is a basic number guessing game written in HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery. It allows a user to start a game where the computer randomly generates a number, and the user attempts to guess the generated number. The user can adjust the range of numbers the computer can generate a random number from (for example, 0..10, 10..100, etc.). If the guess is incorrect, the user will see a message that the guess was either too high or too low.

Once the random number is guessed, the range is increased by 10 for the next round.
